            <p>So, if it has to be a vacation in India that's to be lived in memories for a lifetime, it has to be LADAKH! The colorful monasteries, steep curves, snow-topped peaks, double humped camels, burning sun, freezing winds and a destination that comes straight out of the world of fantasies.
Bordered on the northwest with Pakistan, north with the Chinese province of Sinkiang and east with Tibet, stands this GIANT kingdom.</p>

        <p>Once you are in Leh, relax and let your body acclimatize to this sudden change of altitude.

Be to the Khardungla pass, and feel proud to be at the highest motorable road of the world. Speak to the military men on the route, they have some inspiring stories to share and then head to the Nubhra valley. The major attractions here are White sand dunes and double humped camels for ride.
<p>The another well known place to be is the color changing Pangong Tso lake located next to China border through Changla pass. You would be awfully smitten by the beauty of this "3 idiot's" lake.
</p><p>Life at Ladakh is characterized by intense spiritualities. When you are here, visit the monasteries of Alchi, Diskit & Hunder, Hemis, Lamayuru, Shanti Stupa, Spituk, Thiksey etc. Another thing to look here is the priceless antiques and art. You might even bump into students from different parts of the world, studying Buddhism here.
</p><p>Other major attractions for the tourist worldwide have been the cycling , rafting and trekking expeditions at the region.
</p><p>Even if you are an Indian traveler, this world would not be same like the people you have left behind. Take this road for this is less travelled.. this leads to a whole new unseen world.

        <h3><a href="#">Alaska</a></h3>
        <h6>Written by <a href="#">Nitesh TVS</a> on August 12, 2012.</h6>

		  <p>After long discussions where our next travels would take us, we decided to go for the odd choice of Alaska. Not many Europeans ever consider this lonely state of the US as a travel destination, but we took on the challenge of going on a roadtrip during the month with the longest and (hopefully) warmest days the 49th state has. So we were off in June 2013 to this so called “last frontier” of the USA. Alaska is both the biggest and the least densely populated state with only 700 000 inhabitants of which half of them live in Anchorage.  So imagine the population of a city like Amsterdam living in a country the size of France, Belgium and Italy combined.  This gives a feeling of loneliness, especially if you travel outside of Anchorage.

        <p> The day after, we continued our trip along the same road, driving further North up to the park entrance of Denali National Park to our reserved site at Savage Creek campground.  This National Park is amongst the biggest National Parks in the USA and contains Mount McKinley (6 190m), the highest mountain in North America.  Its vertical relief of 5 500m from base to top is the highest in the world.  We were told the peak of Mount McKinley can only be seen for 20 days/year and it seemed we were going to be lucky!

At night, we went for a moderate walk (although it was still very sunny at 9pm on Jun 21 just below the Arctic circle) from our campground to the bridge over the Savage River, while being super greatful for having brought the headnets we had purchased prior to our trip to avoid the midges.
